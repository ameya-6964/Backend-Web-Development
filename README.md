Welcome to my Backend Web Development Practice repository! This is the place where I will be honing my skills in Node.js, Express.js, EJS, and MongoDB.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, used for server-side scripting. It allows you to run JavaScript code on the server, making it ideal for building scalable network applications.

- **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js, providing a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. It simplifies the process of building web applications and APIs with its minimalist design.

- **EJS (Embedded JavaScript)**: A simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript. It allows you to embed JavaScript code within HTML, making it easier to dynamically generate content on the server.

- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database that provides flexibility and scalability for handling large volumes of data. MongoDB stores data in JSON-like BSON format and is well-suited for projects requiring dynamic, schema-less data storage.
